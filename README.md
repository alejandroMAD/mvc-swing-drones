A simple Java Swing application to operate and monitor two drones flight, demonstrating the use of timers and event handlers in a MVC architectural pattern.

Features
-------------------
* Drones move on the x axis according to the specified pixel velocity and a timer delay.
* Drones operation can be paused, resumed and stopped by action buttons.
* Drones travel distance is shown and updated on the UI.
* Drones speed can be adjusted by slider controls.
* Drones operation stop automatically when their battery value drops to zero.
* A dron's current velocity has an impact on its battery consumption.
* An efficiency ratio enum type affects drone's battery consumption rate.
* A console log allows for printing the object's state at any given time.
